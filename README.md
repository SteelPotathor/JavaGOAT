# Second Year Uni Java Project : Matrimonial Agency

Team for the project : l0rest, [@mihawk](https://github.com/OG-Mihawk) and @SteelPotathor 
Thanks to Mr. Panzoli (PHD) for guiding us through this project.

## Purpose :gem:

The main goal was to put in practice our knowledge of datastructures and algorithms.
We wanted to create a simple and easy to use application where everything is pretty much guided.

### Mantainance ðŸ› 

The code won't be changed, it was a crucial step in my learning curve but I want to move on.

### [Getting Started][project_api_reference] :beginner:

You need to setup this specific VM option : --add-exports=javafx.base/com.sun.javafx.event=org.controlsfx.controls
Without it, search bar will not work properly.
